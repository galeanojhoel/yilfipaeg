/*
    All the following classes are ready to use. If you want 
    to customize a class,it is possible to change the value
    for the properties already defined simply passing a map
    parameter with the property as the key, and the value as 
    himself. This prevents to have two same properties 
    defined at the same class (the class' properties are
    explicited on it's body).
    For additional properties simply set them here.
